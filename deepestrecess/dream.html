            <em>29th night of july</em><br>
            i was time traveling to explore old media events and the last one i got to was Dragon Ball: Super, a bad CGI dragon ball movie from 2002 that looked terrible and shared the name of the yet to come actual DBS manga and anime (thats real you can watch that) and for some reason every single one of these media events was in an attraction at Disneylands Adventure California and you had to go thru a ride line and everything. naturally it always looks like the indiana jones line. i get to the end of the line and its just doors into a terrible thrift shop called Dragon Ball 256-1 and there's a picture of Peter Capaldi doing a dragon ball pose of some kind beneath the title of the store. inside is just like usual thrift store stuff but also i found a switch game called Sunshine 2 + 3 Anniversary edition which was just some bizarre bootleg fake sequel bundle to mario sunshine

            <em>6th morning of june</em><br>
            teh dream was taking place in third person like a video game and an avatar that didnt look like me but i felt was sneaking around some very videogamey level mansion with blue light pouring in the windows so it was visible despite being night (you know for like level design purposes) and i was avoiding the security bots from fnaf security breach and wanted to grab this hand gun i saw on the ground so i could just shoot them, but unfortunately the stalker was another player and came in the room and i had to hide (because its an asymmetrical multiplayer horror experience naturally) and i hid in a cabinet but instead of closing the doors to this armoire i hid in they doors just disappeared but my model also derendered? so i was like ok maybe im fine and i think i said over voice chat or something "i think the games broken" and then the stalker shows up and looks vaguely like a slightly buffer markiplier drags me out of the armoire says "yeah i think so too" and then ya know eats me whole

        </p>
        <p>
            <em>21st night of may</em><br>
            the central conflict of it was that my tooth was infected (this is like real gross i wouldnt if you havent eaten breakfast yet) it was kinda like a zit the diameter of the tooth that got more swollen and red throughout the dream but it was like dented in the center with this black rot attached to the root, i impulsively scratched at the rot and it came off easily but then out came like tendrils the color of puss and they grew for a bit before settling into a position and falling out, after that it just leaked a very watery substance still the same color, and eventually it was empty. the whole time the tooth and puss tasted like blood
            <br>
            once i got that fixed i was just trying to use my phone to keep fnaf characters away in a version of the fnaf 4 bedroom, then i finally got to this site i dreamed up but springtrap was at the door so i got up and shut him out, scheduled my appt at the dentist, the lights turn on and everything changes to yellow happy colors and it's morning time, springtrap is still there but he's the mascot for the dentist site now and a completely different design, he picks me up with one hand and throws me into a mcdonalds sandwich box in his other hand  that glowed on the inside and was filled with trash and i wake up

            jack and i were at a future hotel and im now realizing originally jack was ryan
            <br>
            at some point they switched places
            <br>
            but we were at a nice hotel with a bit of impossible dimension and architecture to it but it wasnt too bad 
            <br>
            it was also a fancy dam
            <br>
            at some point we were trying to cross a calm part of the water flow through the hotel really high up on the like 40th level
            <br>
            and i dunked my head underwater and saw lugia
            <br>
            and suddenly i was playing pokemon snap
            <br>
            automatically got swept up in the rollercoaster like situation pokemon snap is
            <br>
            then came album review tho
            <br>
            and i got embarrassed bcuz i didnt want jack to think i was horny for the pokemon i was taking pictures of because some were saucy
            <br>
            then i noticed theres non pokemon snaps on the album and i had fnaf concept art in the album and the seamless switch to watching a fake fnaf development documentary im my head with steve jobs voice as the voice of scott cawthon explaining his vision

            dream alix has a huge dick,
            <br>
            thats all thanks
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>29th night of april</em><br>
            i dont know how@i can conject the start of it where i couldnt go to the mall because i had to meet my family at ahuge extended family gathering in an ikea like furniture filled warehouse and to my surprise i met alix there and we found out we were like 3rd cousins and then they tried to kiss me in a fake ikea kitchen i pushed them off and they laughed a lot and turns out they took ryans shrooms before coming and then somehow we got stuck on a passenger airliner that took off on its own and i was pissed because there was no way we'd make it to the mall in time now
            <br>
            skip ahead even further (because i don't remember what happened between this) and turns out the worlds ending in 3 days thanks to a meteor hitting japan and me ryan and a random dude ryans dating are like in a bar in tahoe when the news hits and everyone in the bar decides to spend the night there, ryan suggests we make it to his parents house on foot (????) we agree (????????) we spend the night at the bar and move in the morning, its snowing hard on foot was a bad idea, but we make it to my house first which is kinda useless because the powers out because of the storm (very normal and lifelike /srs) but we grab supplies and i stock up on meds including HRT which is there for some reason lol 
            <br>
            THEN HARD SCENE SHIFT im at a huge fancy ass baseball stadium with my mom and brother i want nice boots so i can hike to ryans house better, which my mom doesnt think we'll find at a baseball stadiums but we look anyways and it turns out there's basically a walmart in the stadium right past the wingstop and we find tons of shoes and then we find boots advertised as antimagnetic we say huh that's dumb and it just ends

            <em>4th night of february</em><br>
            this dream invented weather phenomena turns the sky dark orange and features a 40ft diameter column of spiraling black smoke at it's center
            <br>
            also the dream airport has very slick floors that made me tackle Shannon when i ran to hug him after not seeing shan in awhile
            <br>
            the dream airport also provides flying white leather futons for transphobic parents to stand on so they can talk to both their trans kids refusing to answer if they have tape so i can load this final box onto the plane until i walk over the droor to find and use a mix of electrical and packing tape so they can then laud me for doing something independently and fly off to the airplane while i can hear them continue to be transphobic behind my back with magic hearing before someone's like "oh yeah isn't there supposed to be a halidrome tonight" and then the stewardess is informing my parents that yes there will be a halidrome on the tarmac in a moment but it's perfectly safe since we'll be half landed (plane resting diagonally with one wing and the opposite land gear supporting it) and psychological evaluations considered the halidrome to be less traumatizing than a tornado, immediate jump cut to a wide shot of the tarmac as the halidrome is in full swing over a white and green airplane, feel deep dread and a modicum of release and then wake up

            <em>26th night of november</em><br>
            had a dream i joined the navy and i was at the helm and captain rlly liked me but for some reason he was commanding from the lower decks over discord vc and the size of the boat was constantly changing
            <br>
            at one point we submerged and grenades were thrown on top of us
            <br>
            i couldn't see anything while submerged but i could see warthunder damage thing in the bottom left lol 
            <br>
            at some point i was like "wow shannon would love this"
            <br>
            anyways i made the ship take flight and i didnt realize that was weird till i woke up tbh
            <br>
            we snuck thru a window to flank them
            <br>
            the environment changed from like off the coast of india to in just some room
            <br>
            was now piloting flying battleship with insane manuverability
            <br>
            was going good till i went into room with anti aircraft missiles n we went down
            <br>
            but that wasnt the end because the boat grew like 8 really big wheels and i had to drive us out
            <br>
            unfortunately the boat was like shaved down from all the gunfire until it was just me on a chair and a steering wheel
            <br>
            i abandoned what little was left of the ship and it turns out I'm actually an avatar of scout tf2
            <br>
            all of the enemies just on the ground are tf2 characters and theyre also not moving and i died to a Heavy wearing a gibbous a beard and sunglasses next to a sniper in the same outfit
            <br>
            they didnt move either just shot at me lol
            <br>
            anyways once dead i took off the vr goggles because apparently the entire thing was virtual navy but real like enders game or whatever
            <br>
            the end wow weird ass dream
            <br>
            oh and most of the dream really was just walking around on the deck waiting to see if anything would happen because we didnt know if the enemy would actually be there
            <br>
            i just kinda talked on dream discord for most of the wait lol 
            <br>
            finally when i woke up and was looking at my task bar on my pc (that wasnt running windows it was like future OS) there were multiple icons for apps called linux runtime and every icon was a sparkle dog furry head

            <em>3rd night of november</em><br>
            first woke up in own bed but dream to old lady masturbating over my feet and she ran out but she'd also removed every door frame in the house so i couldn't close the door to keep her out, went back to sleep then woke up in metal sports stands to play with a band comprised entirely of my family, i really didnt wanna play was too depressed, walked to the exit at the end and went from outside of stadium to disneyland, then i was at the disneyland elevator that takes you down and out of the park because apparently Disneyland is a mile in the sky, there were two grimy showers in the lobby for some reason and i found two mice i caught there, when i got home it was my childhood texas house and i setup my two new mice with a terrarium that was def too small but they had rc tanks and then i was just dreaming from their point of view

        <p>
            <em>26th night of october</em><br>
            it started as a dream where it was just like a brain video of a made up hbomberguy video making fun of the creator of a historical rankings website cause he's racist and bigoted or whatever and that part was actually very entertaining and the guy was making his defense videos in minecraft and doing it really poorly and his outro was a minecraft title being displayed but he made the redstone timer on the command block way too short, so hbomberguy fixes it and makes an example where its longer, then he makes a funny one where its extremely long and walks around this minecraft house in the nether (which is where it was the whole time) and eventually stops on steve sleeping on a minecraft bed where the title is supposed to popup, but instead the bed gets like shitty blender special effects where it has a wave modifier added to it and stuff like that, and at a certain point it had zoomed out to reveal classic sonic was doin this or whatever, and then eventually everything went into black and white wireframe with a black background and sonic was patting steve on the back really really fast, there was some spooky dialogue that popped up in just block lettering and then sonic started patting his head, it was adding little X hitmarkers all over, then sonic(whos not even really sonic anymore its just a hand) added just a real body but it had like a visible xray skeleton, i really thought that i was still gonna make this a funny dream and that it was surreal but i think i need to pee so dream turned for the worse at this point and the limp human body started to have the back of its head flattened, steves was morphing a lil bit too but i think it was really just turning into a normal human head with its back flattened, pat hand then asks in the block letters if they like it and then it goes back to patting but now its the top of their heads and thise get flattened too, asks if they like it again then declares their finished, then the patting starts back up again suddenly after a few seconds of nothing happening and lil devil horns are made on the brow of each head (now just skulls) and probably brain made up spooky sound or something and i woke up finally

            had a dream that im still thinking about where i saw a tweet on twitter saying "heres a cheat code for a secret ending for avengers endgame featuring marvel zombies antman secret" and then of course i go do it and theres some ant man running away for a bit but then he turns into big mode zombie guy and he nearly eats hawkeye but then a fucking collosal titan version of him rises from the earth mouth open to swallow both the smaller version of himself and hawkeye and he pulls himself out of the earth to wreak havoc and then once hes out it zooms into the giant zombie antmans head and its the angry video game nerd but hes been zombified and hes also giant and hes like the cyclops in homers odyssey and there's a cage of people in the back of the room while he holds a generic brunette damsel in distress while playing a video game and then i think he gets mad and drops her and she dies and he goes "aw banana shit muffins now i gotta clean this up" and then the world just ends and the movies over <b>and somehow the dream still isn't done</b> i go back to twitter and say hey that was cool and then the person that tweeted the original is in my room and theyre like an anthro lizard person and their pfp is them with someone else on a pink tree branch just like floating in the clouds and im like "holy fuck it was you all along" and then we're all hangin on the tree branch in the clouds together and its a happy ending (???)

            <br>
            and for some reason part of the dream towards the end was knowing this is a dream and not knowing its a dream and part of the knowing was that "oh yeah this is a recurring nightmare" but then i actually woke up and realized wait no it fucking isnt ive never had this dream before

            <em>22nd night of march</em>
            <br>
            as early as i can remember deatails i was ghost observing a group stopping a jet that a terrorist was flying with tons of explosives so the good guys were following with their speedy small jet and the person leading was iron man, so he was like "fun fact big jets dont swim well" and then he cut off a tiny little piece of the tip of the tail and it plummeted down and didnt explode but didnt come back above the water and was instead just continuing under the water, however iron man was now piloting the good guys jet and decided to show off how little jets do swim in water well and he was popping it up and out of the water like a dolphin but the terrorist jet was still going and we were just following, it eventually beaches and it's become a big black sperm whale and iron man lands next to it and is just like o fuck she gonna blow and then flys away, 
            <br>
            now naturally this beach is right in the quad of my highschool and I am now standing in it and I run behind a wall to take cover, i see one guy just kneel with his back to the whale like right in front of it and cover his head with his hands and other people hide behind random pillars and then the whale explodes
            <br>
            the explosion nearly crushes me as the wall falls but its caught by another wall and i run out and my first goal is to find all my friends and my sisters and their friends and get them to my dads truck so i first run into annoying girl that had a crush on me and then my ex and im like cool lets go and then i just run into everyone else in a group and im like cool so we run through this hallway and out a door and its nighttime now while before it was noon, 
            <br>
            so we dont see my dads truck at first and hes the getaway driver in his truck, we run around a bit and find him and then half of the group doesnt see him and runs further along but the half im in is like o there he is and gets in, so my dad starts backing up to go get them and he eas doing it for a really long time and i was like "whats up lets go" and he responds "well i cant reach the gas pedal" and thats when i realize that actually im behind the wheel
            <br>
            from this point on i floor it and everything controls and feels like am arcade racing game and i shoot past them really really far and i have a really hard time turning around and then i eventually get back to them after some shoddy racing and then it just ends

            <em>5th night of october</em><br>
            i was at first running around a fusion of my grandparents house and my old big church and ive been to this exact same dream scape before but it had some additions like a front door and a garden, it went from running around exploring it with my siblings and cousins to trying to find a serial killer to then a slasher fic eque sequence where im holding the killer back with a chair and then i just woke up, picked up my phone and saw a meter go to 30% sleep and then turned to my right and a friend was there and he was just changing his clock to random times and then changing it back
