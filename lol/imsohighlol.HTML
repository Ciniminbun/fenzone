I'd revist myself I'd hit the pen and then start typing with puncuation I'd still forget the periods and keep typing just to watch the bar go by This line was written on the fourteenth of march twenty twenty three its the middle of spring break and theonly two people i really care about get back from their trip and i can stop beeing a friendless neet immitator for this break to being that thing but with friends if u feel me and i know you do becauise youre me and you stopped caring about the punctuation a few spelling errors here and there isnt this cool arent i artsy for doing this exxcept its not right becuase its never experienced the magic in the audience response is just absent forever i could delete this right now and its not art, maybe its liek, an exercise? yeah idk whta to call it, play, i would call it play! i'm playing rn my little games n stuff im palyingplaying asjkdfklghjlsfkdhgljk i i i i i nya a;dddddddddddddddddddddd its sunnign ru n sunny ohoooo hop hop bunny scaaary music for scaaary girllllllllls
