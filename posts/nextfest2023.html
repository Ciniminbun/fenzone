                <p>its friday!! update day baby and im sober for this one (maybe i shouldnt be hmmm)</p>
                <p>STEAM NEXT FEST 2023 is here and I've played thru a decent chunk of demos so far. most were rlly good :3 and the bad ones i dont even remember so i wont talk abt them lol</p>
                <p>first up is <b>SURMOUNT</b>!!!<br>
                    this was easily my favorite based on mechacnics alone. the game is incredibly janky at the moment (the demo actually got an update after i played it, i havent seen if it fixed 
                    the phys bugs i found but like they probs did) and found a few ways to send myself flying wayyyyyyy further than you're probably supposed to, which is killer lol. abusing the 
                    winches and water mechanics cracked my skull on every rock i could manage, and once it was finally too much some woman scraped me off the floor and stuck me in a Virtual Reality 
                    Headset. In The Magic World of the Metaverse I Found What I Would Say is a Secret Penis. so like ye neat game, u can make ur little guy, unlock new clothes with a little gacha 
                    machine, and talk to the gayass residents of quirky town. this ones on my wishlist c:
                </p>
                <p>next i played <b>ROBOBEAT</b><br>
                    this was pretty decent. have you played ultrakill? ok cool, what if you had to shoot to the beat of the soundtrack and there were also roguelite elements? that's this game. not
                     a lot else to say rlly lol. the games visual style is lacking, its a little bland, but the music has enough drive to really get into it and kind of just forget ur playing a rhythm game,
                     that's maybe my only issue with this game? its a pretty bland rhythm game, and that's 1 of 2 things that give u reason to play this over ultrakill. coincidentally i dont enjoy 
                     roguelites either, so this one didn't make my wishlist :p
                </p>
                <p>okay i need a smoke break one sec</p><p>ok all good moving on ☞☞☞</p>
                <p>played <b>viewfinder</b><br>
                    you know portal superliminal the talos principle all those guys? this feels like it should be that but oohhhhhhhh boy is this so much more boring. its okay tho lol. the mechanic seems like
                    it could be interesting? it looks technically complicated (though im not a good enough coder to really guess how they did it) but this doesn't come through in the short selection of puzzles in the demo.
                    notably there is a cat, um a rubber ducky i only found one of those, and loooots of Eco Brutalist architecture. so if you're the kind of dork that likes Eco Brutalist Architecture go crazy.
                </p>
                <p><b>Venba</b><br>
                    good game, quiet game. whenever a character speaks all you hear is the scribbling of a pencil. everythings drawn with these rough but soft edges and no music plays until Venba turns on the radio to cook
                    the first dish of the game; some hastily put together idlis based on her mothers smudged recipie. there's a lot of joy woven into this game despite the difficult circumstances of its main characters and i'm looking forward to seeing this family grow when the game is fully released.
                </p>
                <p>i rlly enjoyed <b>Sea of Stars</b><br>
                    i was surprised i liked it so much but this is a straightforward fantasy rpg with some excellent sprite work. the games battle state can have the characters facing any angle which also means
                    that they animated every attack and skill from 8 angles. nothing about this game is particularly unique but its pleasant to look at and fun to play with its mario & luigi style battle system.
                    the story seems coincidental but i have no complaints from the short snippet i got of it. this ones on my wishlist because it just seems like a chill easygoing game to play in the evening.
                </p>
                <p>not a next fest game but i also played <br><b>Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective Demo</b><br>
                    i went into this completely blind! people on twitter kept telling me to go buy this game so i finally got to see what was up with it from this demo. turns out its like a good game :O!! who couldve guessed?! 
                    here is my advice: go play the Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective Demo. that is all, thank you, smoke a fat one, good night.
                </p>
                <p>wow! video game!! thats all i got this week so like um thx c:</p>
