                <h6 style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">no way 2 sugar coat it i am embarrased by this page but i leave it up so i can look at it later and remember i guess</h6>
                <p>2 weeks ago now i finished anodyne 2. i'd been playing this game for months and every occasional time i'd load it i'd find more 
                    reason to Love It. whats fun is that i was so annoyed at this game at the start. i was playing the game as a chore it was one 
                    of many games in my backlog list that i've been tackling at a glacial pace for the past few years. anodyne 2 was a game i received 
                    in a charity bundle. usually id cross the game off my list and move on i'd dismiss this as another in a long line of disappointments,
                    but there was genuinely something enthralling lurking beneath the surface of this game. the introduction is such a treat! its 
                    this odd tutorial spread out between three scare crows with hefty yellow smiley balls for faces reminiscent of egg yolks. that 
                    is after all their whole deal. they're yolks. this primordial miniscule concept of birth, the delicious beginnings of the players 
                    life as they're birthed into the strange and uncompromising world of anodyne 2. after all this birthing business you get to meet 
                    your moms: palisade and c psalmist. the christian undertones of the work are made starkly clear here and i accepted my quest from 
                    mom to make things clean again. i'm instructed to walk among the unwashed masses, and make them clean again. its maybe one of the 
                    less subtle christ allegories ive seen in my itty bitty short life but i give it huge points for style. and somehow despite all this 
                    i let the gamer goblins in my brain get the best of me. this game feels terrible to play full stop. the schmovement is nonexistant 
                    every animation feels hasty and tasteless. the game mechanics at play are meager. long bouts of exploring this strange world are 
                    only briefly interupted by top down zelda dungeons. everything's pretty ugly. i say this with love. this game was not designed to be 
                    easily loved. it is completely uninterested in ease. it has texture. its juxtaposed to the triple A crystal clear video games of 
                    today as a game that appears crunchy with its baked in low render resolution and muddy textures. it really revels in its imperfections.
                    i couldn't see why that was so important at first and i put the game down as a meh on my backlog. i stopped progressing on the backlog at all.
                    i think i've grown all to accustomed to comfort, and games don't necessarily deliver that. a game is a challenge a game is something you 
                    can fail miserably. something in my life blew out the spark in my heart that saw value in this. i think im better now, and i 
                    credit that to this game that is so obviously bursting with love for everything and everyone. i'm too young to be this depressed, to be this stuck.
                    this game gave me just a little hope that things can be otherwise.
